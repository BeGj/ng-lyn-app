Rain background... year, a little bit annoying :D

Random thundersound when thunder appears.

## Openlayers with opengl for map rendering

## NGRX/ Redux

Don't remember but I'm pretty sure I never finished NGRX for this app, since it was so small. So please ignore `src/app/ligthning-map/state` and `src/app/state`

## Deploy to github pages

run `ng deploy --base-href=/ng-lyn-app/`
